  This is a code bundle for FakeCheck Web Interface Design. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/V2zieG7fxZcHKKMzDUAgJ2/FakeCheck-Web-Interface-Design.

  ## Environment Setup

  Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with the following variable:

  ```
  VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
  ```

  Replace `http://localhost:8000` with your actual backend URL. For production, use your production backend URL.

  **Note:** In Vite, environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` to be accessible in the browser.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
